//  Variable Name Laws
// 1. Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and dollar signs.
// 2. Names must begin with a letter.
// 3. Names can also begin with a dollar sign or underscore.
// 4. Names are case sensitive (eg: age and AGE are not thesame thing)
// 5. Reserved words ( Javascript keywords) cannot be used as names.

// var first_name = "Mark"
// first_name = "Mark"
// alert(first_name)

// Project 1
var username = prompt("what is your username?")


//Concatenation
let firstName = "Mark"
let lastName = "Grayson"
let fullName = firstName + lastName
alert(fullName)
